                 <h3> Alfered Hitchcock </h3>
                 <p>Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock directed and produced the film
                 Vertigo in 1958. Based on a novel by Boileau-Narcejac, Dâ€™entre
                 les morts (novel title), was a film about a main character with
                 both acrophobia and vertigo gained from an accident while working
                 on the police force. These properties of the characters fear 
                 force the main character from working on the police force and 
                 the story follows as he privately investigates an acquaintances
                 wife for work afterwards. The story then unfolds into a deep and
                 tense situations of suspense as the character is led to believe
                 that the wife is possessed and kills herself by jumping from a 
                 high place which the main character was unable to save her from
                 because of his fear. The thriller continues but   to enlighten 
                 more information would defeat the purpose of watching one of 
                 greatest and most influential films in British cinematography.
