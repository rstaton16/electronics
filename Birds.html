                 <h3> Alfred Hitchcock </h3>
                 <p>The Birds directed by Alfred Hitchcock and released in 1963,
                 is one of the most iconic and influential horror movies in the 
                 film industry to date. The movie takes apart the unknown suspense
                 and horror to the audience of sudden and fatal bird attacks in 
                 the California coast area. The film details the lengths that 
                 people took to get away from the birds who attacked them with 
                 lethal force. The film shows a frenzy of different groups at 
                 the beginning trying to avoid the bird attacks and investigating
                 why the birds were acting in a peculiar manner. As the film 
                 progresses the shock and awe factor is taken in and multiplied 
                 by the number of on scene incidences of massive flocks of birds
                 attacking and imprisoning people to safety. The film in a 
                 nutshell without being spoiled is built on the suspense of never
                 knowing if the birds will continue to attack or when they 
                 will stop.
